# Speedtest Viasat
## App presented in the Inatel App Challenge 2021

The proposed challenge: create an app to provide connection speed tests. The app must be a PWA, provides the user's location, the ISP name and possible connection issues.

This project was based on the [PWA-Framework-Speedtest](https://github.com/Viasat/PWA-Framework-Speedtest)

The app has a responsive interface to fit computer and smartphones screens:
